# Task-Board

## My Task

For this challenge,I created a smiple task board which allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app was created usingD HTML,CSS and jQuery. I did add Day.js library to work with dates.

## User Story
As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize , I want a task board so that
I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist

## What Did I learn
I was able to implement almost every method that I have learned so far for this challenge.
I was able to use almost whatever I have studied so far, and it was a good practice.

## Challenges
This challenge was difficult and time consuming. I was lost and wasn't sure where to start .I did rewatch some of the recordings, and read the documentations. Also, combining jQuery with javascript in the challenge made it even harder.
